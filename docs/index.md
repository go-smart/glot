This project is co-funded by the European Commission under grant agreement no. 600641.

This tool, GSSA, provides scripts for running a generic simulation server, with support for Docker-based webuser-configurable simulation tools, and the configuration for the [Crossbar.io](https://crossbar.io) WAMP router.

## Dependencies

* Python 2.7
* Python 3
* [Elmer (with NUMA modifications)](https://github.com/go-smart/gssf-elmer)
* GMSH
* VTK 5.8
* libjsoncpp-dev
* (Python 3) munkres pyyaml
* (Python 2) PythonOCC

## Installation

CMake installation is recommended from an out-of-source build directory.

## Usage

The simulation workflow may be launched by the command

```sh
  go-smart-launcher settings.xml
```

where `settings.xml` is a GSSF-XML file. Adding --help will show documentation of command line arguments.
